# Realtime-Renderer
A basic realtime 3D render engine built using Direct3D 11 with some basic game engine concepts. This project was submitted as one of my university assignments.

Includes [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog) for debugging.

Direct3D 11 was... really annoying to use. Especially since learning material for DirectX 10 and 12 are basically useless for DirectX 11.
